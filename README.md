# Check To Check
[Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/24/most-americans-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html) and struggle to make ends meet. I am developing Check to Check as a personal finance web application that teaches financial literacy, starting with the basics: surviving from paycheck to paycheck. 

## Goals for this Project (these are subject to change!)
- Practice SCRUM development patterns w/ frequent sprints (so as long as I remain unemployed); in place of stand-ups, document the experience in a thread on Twitter
- Test driven development for the back-end with Mocha and Chai
- Test driven development for the front-end with Enzyme and Jest
- Ensure that client-side errors are logged and saved somewhere
- Create a mobile-first experience that is accessible and as WCAG-compliant as possible
- Create an isomorphic React app
- (Optional) Incorporate a new technology like GatsbyJS on the front-end or GraphQL on the back-end
- Debut the finished MVP on ProductHunt and collect feedback

## User Stories (these are subject to change!)
As a user:
- I can add my gross (monthly or bi-weekly) income
- I can create a list of bills
- Each individual bill includes a title, the amount, due date, recurrence, and priority
- I can see an estimate of my outgoings each month
- I can create a [zero-based budget](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/zero-based-budget-what-why), or get as close to it as possible
- When I get paid, I can get an e-mail or text message that instructs me on what bills to pay right now and what bills to hold off on
- (Optional) At the end of each month, I can recount my actual spending and review my budget for the next month
- Based on my bills and spending habits, I can get suggestions on how to save money and how to budget my income
- I can learn about techniques and sacrifices needed to attain a debt-free lifestyle

## MVP Goals
- Coming soon!

### About The Idea
I've always felt like budgeting apps were never meant for poor people, or people that literally live from paycheck to paycheck. Instead, they just offer you an alternative of being able to look at pretty UI and see your account balances without logging into your bank's website or app. Instead of encouraging and teaching solid financial advice that is reproducible and has a proven track record, most of these apps just show you ads for credit cards or shower you with "special" deals for refinancing your mortgage, car loan, or whatever.

I originally created a budgeting app called [Windfall](https://windfall-app.netlify.com/) while completing Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program, but had nowhere near enough time to build out the project that I had in my mind. Ultimately, my goal with Check to Check is encourage people to follow the financial advice from the likes of personalities like Dave Ramsey and Jarim Person-Lynn, whom I believe to have the only real, attainable (and inclusive) advice to building long-term, generational wealth: get out of debt or die trying. If you visit their social media profiles and read their content, they have changes hundreds to thousands of lives with their advice. Sadly, in the U.S., we're obsessed with debt and most of us succumb to it, by circumstance or choice. 

The app most similar to what I'm building would be [YNAB (You Need A Budget)](https://www.youneedabudget.com/), however, Check to Check will focus on encouraging the teachings of Dave Ramsey and Jarim Person-Lynn, offering advice and insight based on their steps to get out of debt.
